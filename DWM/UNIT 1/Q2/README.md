Q2. Explain about datawarehouse and characteristics of datawarehouse.

Bill Inmon, considered to be the father of Data Warehousing provides the following definition:
“A Data Warehouse is a subject oriented, integrated, nonvolatile, and time variant collection of data in support of management’s decisions.”
• Provides an integrated and total view of the enterprise
• Makes the enterprise’s current and historical information easily available for decisions
• Makes decision-support transactions possible without hindering operational systems
• Renders the organization’s information consistent
• Presents a flexible and interactive source of strategic information

The data warehouse exists to answer questions users have about the business, the performance of the various operations, the business trends, and about what can be done to improve the business. The data warehouse exists to provide business users with direct access to data, to provide a single unified version of the performance indicators, to record the past accurately, and to provide the ability to view the data from many different perspectives. In short, the data warehouse is there to support decisional processes.

A data warehouse is not a single software or hardware product you purchase to provide strategic information. It is, rather, a computing environment where users can find strategic information, an environment where users are put directly in touch with the data they need to make better decisions. It is a user-centric environment.

A common way of introducing data warehousing is to refer to the characteristics of a data warehouse: 1. Subject Oriented 2. Integrated 3. Nonvolatile 4. Time Variant

⸻

1. Subject Oriented
   • Data warehouses are designed to help analyze data. For example, to learn more about banking data, a warehouse can be built that concentrates on transactions, loans, etc.
   • This warehouse can be used to answer questions like:
   “Which customer has taken maximum loan amount for last year?”
   • This ability to define a data warehouse by subject matter, such as “loan” in this case, makes the data warehouse subject oriented.

⸻

2. Integrated
   • A data warehouse is constructed by integrating multiple, heterogeneous data sources like relational databases, flat files, and online transaction records.
   • The data collected is cleaned, and then data integration techniques are applied, which ensures consistency in:
   • Naming conventions
   • Encoding structures
   • Attribute measures
   • Across different data sources

⸻

3. Non-volatile
   • Nonvolatile means that, once data is entered into the warehouse, it cannot be removed or changed.
   • This is because the purpose of a data warehouse is to analyze the data, not to update it like in transactional systems.

⸻

4. Time Variant
   • A data warehouse maintains historical data.
   • For example, if a customer record has details of his job, a data warehouse would maintain all of his previous job history (historical information).
   • This contrasts with a transactional system, which typically maintains only current data, making it difficult to retrieve older records.
