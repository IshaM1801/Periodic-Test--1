Top-Down Approach

Advantages:
• A truly corporate effort, an enterprise view of data
• Inherently architected—not a union of disparate data marts
• Single, central storage of data about the content
• Centralized rules and control
• May see quick results if implemented with iterations

Disadvantages:
• Takes longer to build even with an iterative method
• High exposure/risk to failure
• Needs high level of cross-functional skills
• High outlay without proof of concept

Bottom-Up Approach

Advantages:
• Faster and easier implementation of manageable pieces
• Favorable return on investment and proof of concept
• Less risk of failure
• Inherently incremental; can schedule important data marts first
• Allows project team to learn and grow

Disadvantages:
• Each data mart has its own narrow view of data
• Permeates redundant data in every data mart
• Perpetuates inconsistent and irreconcilable data
• Proliferates unmanageable interfaces
