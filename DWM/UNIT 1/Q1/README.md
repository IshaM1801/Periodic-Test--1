Q1. Write a short note on Operational Support System

Ans: An Operational Support System (OSS) is a category of information systems that helps manage and support the day-to-day business operations of an organization. It is primarily application-oriented, meaning it is developed with a specific business process or operational goal in mind, such as processing transactions, managing inventory, or tracking customer orders.

OSS plays a vital role in ensuring that routine business activities are carried out efficiently and accurately. It is used to run the business by dealing with detailed, transactional-level data that is always current and up to date. This is essential for real-time decision-making and maintaining business continuity.

The data in an OSS is usually isolated and highly structured, making it easy to access and update. It supports repetitive access patterns, as users frequently perform similar operations like entering, editing, or retrieving data. These systems are typically used by clerical or operational staff rather than by senior management.

OSS is performance sensitive, which means it must deliver quick response times and handle many transactions simultaneously without delays. Normally, only a few records are accessed at a time—typically in tens—making performance tuning a key concern. Data access in OSS systems is primarily for reading and updating, rather than complex analytics or querying.

A good OSS ensures no data redundancy, which maintains consistency and reduces storage costs. The database size in such systems generally ranges between 100 MB to 100 GB, depending on the size and scale of the organization.

In summary, Operational Support Systems are essential for handling the core operational tasks of a business.
