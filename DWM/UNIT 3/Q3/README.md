# 🌐 Naive Bayes Classifier – Overview & Real-World Example

## 📘 How Naive Bayes Makes Predictions

Naive Bayes is a **probabilistic classification algorithm** based on **Bayes' Theorem**. It is used to predict the class of a given instance by calculating the **posterior probability** for each class, given the input features.

### 🔢 Prediction Steps:

1. **Calculate Prior Probability**  
   For each class \( C_k \):  
   \[
   P(C_k) = \frac{\text{Instances in class } C_k}{\text{Total number of instances}}
   \]

2. **Compute Likelihoods**  
   For each feature \( x_i \), compute:  
   \[
   P(x_i | C_k)
   \]

3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**  
   \[
   P(C*k | x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) \propto P(C_k) \cdot \prod*{i=1}^{n} P(x_i | C_k)
   \]

4. **Choose the Class with Maximum Posterior**  
   The final prediction is the class with the highest value of the posterior probability.

## 🤔 The "Naive" Assumption

Naive Bayes assumes that all features are **conditionally independent given the class**.  
That is:
\[
P(x*1, x_2, ..., x_n | C_k) = \prod*{i=1}^{n} P(x_i | C_k)
\]

This is a **strong assumption** and often doesn't hold in real-world data. However, it still works well in practice due to its simplicity and efficiency, especially for high-dimensional data.

## 📦 Real-World Example: Weather Data – _Play Tennis?_

Below is the dataset used to train a Naive Bayes classifier:

| Outlook  | Temperature | Humidity | Windy | PlayTennis |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Sunny    | Hot         | High     | False | No         |
| Sunny    | Hot         | High     | True  | No         |
| Overcast | Hot         | High     | False | Yes        |
| Rain     | Mild        | High     | False | Yes        |
| Rain     | Cool        | Normal   | False | Yes        |
| Rain     | Cool        | Normal   | True  | No         |
| Overcast | Cool        | Normal   | True  | Yes        |
| Sunny    | Mild        | High     | False | No         |
| Sunny    | Cool        | Normal   | False | Yes        |
| Rain     | Mild        | Normal   | False | Yes        |
| Sunny    | Mild        | Normal   | True  | Yes        |
| Overcast | Mild        | High     | True  | Yes        |
| Overcast | Hot         | Normal   | False | Yes        |
| Rain     | Mild        | High     | True  | No         |

### 🔍 Problem Statement:

**Given:**

- Outlook = Sunny
- Temperature = Cool
- Humidity = High
- Windy = True

**Goal:** Predict whether the person will play tennis (`Yes` or `No`).

### 🧮 Solution using Naive Bayes:

1. Calculate the prior probabilities for `PlayTennis = Yes` and `No`.
2. Compute the likelihood of each given attribute for both classes.
3. Apply Bayes’ Theorem to calculate posterior probabilities.
4. **Prediction:** Choose the class with the higher posterior.
